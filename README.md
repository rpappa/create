# @rpappa/create

Personalized TypeScript project template, includes the following:

-   TypeScript
-   Opinionated linting / formatting
-   Testing, with ts-jest

Goals for this project:

1. Reduce setup time for personal TypeScript projects
2. Get more in the habit of using linting and testing for personal projects

Long term I'd like to migrate the TypeScript and eslint configs to their own packages, but this will do for now.
